<strong>Lily's Museum of Arts</strong>
Do you want to add more color to your life in your house?! Follow my step-by-step directions to create your own gallery!
Step 1.  Create a lot of art.
Step 2.  Find somewhere with space( as much as you need to put all your art inside and have room for your tourists, artists, students, etc. to walk around).
Step 3.  <strong>Clean up if it's messy( very important!)</strong>
Step 4. Decorate the area! Make it look ike an art gallery, a palace inside, anywhere you want your gallery to be!
Last step. Invite your friends! Or it won't be a gallery anymore!
