<strong>Lily's Museum of Arts</strong>
1. Do you want to add more color to your life in your house?! Follow my step-by-step directions to create your own gallery!
2.  Create a lot of art.<br>
3. Find somewhere with space( as much as you need to put all your art inside and have room for your tourists, artists, students, etc. to walk around).
4. <strong>Clean up if it's messy( very important!)</strong>
5. Decorate the area! Make it look ike an art gallery, a palace inside, anywhere you want your gallery to be!
Last step. Invite your friends! Or it won't be a gallery anymore!
<strong>            Also selling artwork online! Don't miss the latest updates!</strong>
Oh, and label the sections you have of art like, Living Things and give it examples like People, Animals, etc.
